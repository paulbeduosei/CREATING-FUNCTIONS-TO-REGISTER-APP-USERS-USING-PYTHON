# CREATING-FUNCTIONS-TO-REGISTER-APP-USERS-USING-PYTHON
Building Secure and Reliable User Registration Systems 🔐💻

As a junior developer at a start-up, I designed a mobile app account registration system with robust input validation.

Leveraging helper functions for name, email, and password verification, I ensured that user data is properly validated before account creation. 

The system also includes error handling to enhance reliability and security, providing a seamless and safe onboarding experience for users.
